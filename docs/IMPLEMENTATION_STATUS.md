# PowerByExcellence - Implementation Status

> **Last updated:** 25 June 2026  
> **Stack:** Laravel 13 · Vue 3 · Inertia · SQLite/MySQL · Laravel Queues  
> **Tests:** 235 passing (`php artisan test`)

This document is the **live inventory** of what is built today. For the full LeadByte specification, see [`LEADBYTE_REPLICA_DEV_DOC.md`](./LEADBYTE_REPLICA_DEV_DOC.md). For navigation UX recommendations, see [`UX_NAVIGATION_AUDIT.md`](./UX_NAVIGATION_AUDIT.md).

---

## Quick Start

```bash
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
npm install && npm run build

# Terminal 1 - web
php artisan serve   # or use Herd: powerbyexcellence.test

# Terminal 2 - REQUIRED for async lead processing
php artisan queue:work
```

> **Important:** Without `php artisan queue:work`, async API leads (`POST /api/v1/leads` without `"sync": true`) will sit in the `jobs` table and never process.

---

## Demo Accounts

All passwords: **`password`**

| Email | Role | Platform |
|-------|------|----------|
| `admin@powerbyexcellence.test` | Super Admin | All (switch at `/accounts`) |
| `uk@powerbyexcellence.test` | Account Admin | Excellence Leads UK |
| `us@powerbyexcellence.test` | Account Admin | Partner Solar US |
| `buyer-portal@excellence-uk.test` | Buyer Portal | UK |
| `supplier-portal@excellence-uk.test` | Supplier Portal | UK |
| `buyer-portal@partner-solar-us.test` | Buyer Portal | US |
| `supplier-portal@partner-solar-us.test` | Supplier Portal | US |

**Seeded references**

| Platform | Campaign | Buyers | Supplier SID |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|
| UK | `auto-insurance-uk`, `loans-uk`, `mortgage-uk`, `payday-loans-uk`, `solar-uk` | `buyer-primary`, `buyer-secondary` | `google_search` |
| US | `auto-insurance-us`, `loans-us`, `mortgage-us`, `payday-loans-us`, `solar-us` | `buyer-primary`, `buyer-secondary` | `google_search` |

API keys are printed once when you run `php artisan db:seed` - copy immediately.

## How Laravel Job Queues Work Here

### Yes - the platform uses Laravel queues

| Component | File | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| Job class | `app/Jobs/ProcessLeadJob.php` | Implements `ShouldQueue`; runs `LeadPipeline` |
| Default driver | `config/queue.php` | `database` (jobs stored in `jobs` table) |
| Dispatch points | `LeadController`, `CsvImportService`, `QuarantineController` | Queue lead after ingest |

### Async vs sync ingest

```
POST /api/v1/leads
        │
        ├── "sync": true  → LeadPipeline::process() runs immediately in the HTTP request
        │                   Returns final status (sold/unsold/rejected) in response
        │
        └── default (async) → ProcessLeadJob::dispatch($leadId)
                              Returns 202 { status: "queued", queue_id, lead_id }
                              Worker picks up job → sets AccountContext → runs pipeline
```

**Poll async status:** `GET /api/v1/leads/queue/{queueId}`

### Job behaviour

- **Retries:** 3 attempts, 5s backoff
- **Tenancy:** Job loads lead `withoutGlobalScopes()`, sets `AccountContext` from lead's campaign account before processing
- **Failure:** Lead marked `rejected` with reason `Queue processing failed`

### Other queue usage

- CSV import dispatches one `ProcessLeadJob` per imported row
- Quarantine release re-dispatches processing job
- Reprocess API: `POST /api/v1/leads/{uuid}/reprocess`

---

## How Ping-Post & Ping-Tree Work

### Ping-post (single delivery)

A **delivery** with `method: ping_post` runs a two-step HTTP flow in `DeliveryExecutor`:

```
1. PING  - partial fields only (campaign fields marked ping_field=true)
           POST → ping_url (timeout: config.ping_timeout, default 5s)
           Logged to delivery_logs.ping_request / ping_response

2. Evaluate ping response
           - matchesPingSuccess() checks Success + floor price (Cost >= campaign floor)
           - If rejected → delivery skipped, try next in routing

3. POST  - full lead fields + ping response interpolation
           POST → post_url (timeout: config.timeout, default 10s)
           Logged to delivery_logs.post_request / post_response

4. Revenue from RevenueCalculator (fixed / dynamic Cost field / rule-based)
```

**Built-in simulators for testing** (no auth required):

- `POST /api/v1/ping` → `{ Success: true, Cost: 15, PingID: "ping_..." }`
- `POST /api/v1/post` → `{ Success: true, Approved: true }`

Seeded UK delivery **"Ping Post - Primary Buyer"** points at these URLs.

### Ping-tree (advanced distribution)

When a campaign has `use_advanced_distribution: true`, `DistributionEngine` reads the active `DistributionConfig` and processes **tiered groups** in order:

```
Campaign (advanced mode)
    └── DistributionConfig (e.g. "Hybrid Ping Tree")
            └── groups[] - each tier has:
                    name, mode, floor_price?, delivery_ids[]
                    mode → RoutingMode enum:
                        waterfall        - priority order until sold
                        parallel_auction - ping all deliveries, highest bid ≥ floor wins
                        sequential_ping  - same as waterfall for ping deliveries
                        weighted         - random pick by delivery.weight
                        round_robin      - rotate fairly between deliveries
```

**Flow per lead:**

```
LeadPipeline (validated, deduped)
    → DistributionEngine::distribute()
        → distributeAdvanced() OR distributeStandard()
            → For each tier group:
                → Filter deliveries by delivery_ids, caps, credit, rules
                → Run mode-specific logic
                → If sold & exclusive → finalizeSold (financials, buyer charge, webhooks)
            → If no tier sells → finalizeUnsold (or quarantine)
```

**Admin UI:**

| Page | URL | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| Ping Tree list | `/distribution` | View/edit tier configs per campaign |
| Ping Tree form | `/distribution/create`, `/distribution/{id}/edit` | Visual tier builder |
| Live Operations | `/operations` | KPIs, recent leads, delivery preview (links to full logs) |
| Delivery Logs | `/logs/delivery` | Filterable ping-post/direct audit trail with drill-down |
| Campaign show | `/campaigns/{id}` | Shows linked ping-tree configs |
| Deliveries | `/deliveries` | Per-buyer delivery methods (ping_post, direct_post, etc.) |

**Seeded example (UK):**

- Tier 1: `parallel_auction`, floor £10
- Tier 2: `waterfall` fallback
- Both tiers reference the Store Lead delivery (demo simplification)

## How Multi-Tenancy Works

### Concept

Each **Account** is an isolated partner platform (tenant). All business data belongs to one account.

### AccountContext (request-scoped)

`app/Support/Tenancy/AccountContext.php` holds the current tenant ID for the duration of a request or job.

**Set by middleware:**

| Middleware | When | How |
|------------|------|-----|
| `SetAccountFromUser` | Web (auth) | From `user.account_id`, or buyer/supplier's account, or super-admin session `current_account_id` |
| `AuthenticateApiKey` | API | From API key's `account_id` |

### BelongsToAccount trait

Models using `BelongsToAccount` (Campaign, Lead, Buyer, Supplier, ApiKey, Webhook, etc.):

1. **Global scope** - all queries auto-filter `WHERE account_id = AccountContext::id()`
2. **Auto-fill** - new records get `account_id` from context on create

### Isolation guarantees

- Admin user on UK platform only sees UK campaigns, leads, buyers
- API key scoped to one account - cannot ingest to another tenant's campaigns
- `ProcessLeadJob` explicitly sets context from lead's campaign account
- Super admin switches tenant at `/accounts` → session stores `current_account_id`

### Portal users

- Buyer/supplier portal users link via `buyer_id` / `supplier_id`
- `User::buyer()` / `supplier()` load **without global scopes** (fixes cross-scope lookup)
- `SetAccountFromUser` resolves account from buyer/supplier when `account_id` absent

### Test coverage

- `MultiTenancyTest` - scoped campaign queries
- `LeadIngestApiTest::test_multi_tenant_isolation` - cannot post to another account's campaign
- `PlatformModulesTest` - UK and US admins isolated

- 2 buyers with ledger top-ups (£500 / £250)
- 1 supplier + 1 source (`google_search`)
- 4 deliveries: Store, Ping Post, Direct API, Email
- 1 DistributionConfig (Hybrid Ping Tree, 2 tiers)
- 5 sold demo leads + financials
- 1 pending lead in queue
- Admin + supplier API keys
- Portal users for buyer and supplier

---

## Call logic - noted, not implementing yet

The platform does **not** support live call routing today. Ping tree and deliveries are **HTTP-only** (ping/post, email, SMS). Phone numbers are lead fields + fraud validation, not voice sessions.

**Decision:** Call logic is documented for future planning only - **no implementation in the current build.**

When prioritised, treat it as a **separate “Call Routing” module** (not a bolt-on to the HTTP ping tree):

| Reuse | Build new |
|-------|-----------|
| Buyer caps, schedules, eligibility, financials, postbacks | `CallSession` model, inbound DNI/tracking numbers |
| `RuleEngine` for geo | Twilio Voice (or Telnyx) webhooks + transfer |
| Tier/floor concepts from distribution | Call ping-for-accept → warm transfer → disposition API |

**Suggested MVP (future):** campaign channel `call`, inbound DID → waterfall over call-capable buyers → `<Dial>` transfer → `POST /api/v1/calls/{id}/disposition` → connect-rate in reports. Hybrid campaigns could fall back to HTTP ping tree when unsold.

**Enum stubs only (unwired):** `DeliveryMethod::TwoStepAuth`, `DeliveryMethod::CampaignTransfer`.

## Known Limitations

1. **Queue worker required** - async leads need `php artisan queue:work`
2. **Stripe** - configuration UI + webhook stub; full Checkout flow in buyer portal is next step
3. **Lead source sync** - webhook ingest accepts payloads; field mapping to campaigns is manual/demo queue
4. **Parallel auction** - pings all buyers then picks winner; no distributed lock
5. **Super admin on tenant** - god mode via “Open portal”; Command Center / Partner Platforms are central-host only
6. **Buyer form** - includes Advanced tab (pricing, caps, geo, auto top-up thresholds)
7. **Users** - renamed from Employees; super admin hidden on partner platform user lists
8. **Demo data** - `DemoHistoricalDataSeeder` seeds 30 days of leads per tenant (`migrate:fresh --seed`)

## Suggested Next Build Order

### UX / navigation (see [`UX_NAVIGATION_AUDIT.md`](./UX_NAVIGATION_AUDIT.md))

1. Campaign **go-live checklist** on show page
2. Promote **Buyers** + **Billing** to top nav; slim **More** menu
3. Plain-English nav labels (Today, Held leads, Buyer connections)
4. Unified **logs** hub with lead UUID search
5. Delivery **quick setup** path + test CTA

### Product / integrations

1. Stripe Checkout in buyer portal (charge + ledger credit)
2. Lead source field mapping UI + automatic campaign ingest
3. FTP / scheduled CSV exports
4. Full 2FA TOTP login challenge
5. 2-step auth delivery method
6. User edit form in admin
