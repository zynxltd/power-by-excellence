# Partner Platforms

**Route:** `/accounts` (central host, super admin only)

Partner platforms are **tenant accounts** - isolated lead distribution instances on dedicated subdomains (e.g. `excellence-uk.powerbyexcellence.test`).

## Self-service model

Every partner platform is **fully self-serviced** by its tenant admin. After provisioning, the partner runs their own:

- Campaigns, deliveries, and ping trees
- Buyers, suppliers, and portal users
- Branding, platform settings, and API keys
- Buyer billing, credits, and day-to-day operations

**Super admin role** is intentionally lightweight: provision new platforms, monitor cross-tenant health (Command Center, Live Feed), handle billing locks, and use god mode or impersonation only when support is needed. You should not need to manage buyers, suppliers, or campaigns for healthy tenants.

## Listing

The index shows every `Account` with:

- Brand name and slug
- Resolved domain (`accounts.domain` or `{slug}.{base_domain}`)
- Counts: campaigns, leads, buyers, suppliers
- Primary admin user (first `account_admin` or `staff`)

## Switching context (central host)

**Switch** sets `session('current_account_id')` without leaving the central host. Use this when:

- Browsing super-admin notification tools scoped to one tenant
- Preparing to open tenant-scoped admin routes that read session context

This does **not** log you in on the tenant subdomain - data may still be filtered incorrectly for subdomain-only features.

## Visiting a tenant (recommended)

**Visit** is the correct way to manage a tenant:

1. Sets `current_account_id` and `god_mode` in session
2. On central host: redirects to tenant subdomain via one-time handoff token
3. On tenant host already: redirects to tenant dashboard

See [God Mode](./god-mode.md).

## Tenant isolation

- All operational data is scoped by `account_id`
- Buyers, suppliers, campaigns, and leads never cross tenants
- Portal users authenticate only on their tenant hostname

## Creating tenants

Super admins provision new partner platforms from the **central host** (`powerbyexcellence.test` in local dev).

### UI flow

1. Sign in as **super admin** on the central host.
2. Open **Partner Platforms** (`/accounts`).
3. Click **New platform** (`/accounts/create`).
4. Complete the form:
   - **Platform name** - display label for the tenant.
   - **Subdomain slug** - becomes `{slug}.{base_domain}` (e.g. `acme-leads.powerbyexcellence.test`).
   - **Custom domain** (optional) - override the default subdomain hostname.
   - **Country, currency, timezone** - defaults for new campaigns and billing.
   - **Account admin** - first tenant user (`account_admin` role) who can configure buyers, suppliers, and campaigns.
5. Submit. The platform appears on the partner list immediately.
6. **Local dev:** run `herd link {slug}.{base_domain}` or `php artisan platform:link-tenants` so the subdomain resolves.
7. Use **Open portal ↗** or **Visit** to enter god mode on the new tenant.

The provisioner creates only the `Account` record and one `account_admin` user - no demo buyers, suppliers, or campaigns. Configure those after visiting the tenant portal.

### API / code

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `accounts.create` | GET | Create form |
| `accounts.store` | POST | Provision tenant |

Service: `App\Services\Platform\TenantProvisioner`.

### Required data

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `name` | Platform display name |
| `slug` | Subdomain segment (unique, lowercase) |
| `domain` | Optional custom hostname |
| `default_currency` | GBP, USD, CAD, EUR, etc. |
| `default_country` | 2-letter ISO code |
| `timezone` | PHP timezone identifier |
| `admin_name`, `admin_email`, `admin_password` | First tenant admin |

Reserved slugs (`api`, `admin`, `www`, etc.) are rejected.

### Demo / seed data

Seeded demo tenants come from `database/seeders/PlatformSeeder.php` and `config/tenant_platforms.php` with full buyers, suppliers, and campaigns. Use the UI flow above for real onboarding without demo data.

## DNS & environments

| Environment | Pattern |
|-------------|---------|
| Local (Herd) | `{slug}.powerbyexcellence.test` |
| Production | Custom domain or `{slug}.powerbyexcellence.com` |

`TenantResolver::portalUrl()` builds correct URLs for visit/handoff links.

## Tips

- Use **Command Center** for at-a-glance health before visiting a troubled tenant
- Document which slug maps to which commercial partner for support handoffs
